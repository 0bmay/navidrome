GoSonic
=======

### About

__This is still a work in progress, and has no releases available__ 

GoSonic is an application that implements the [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp), but instead of
having its own music library like the original [Subsonic application](http://www.subsonic.org), it interacts directly
with your iTunes library.

The project's main goals are:

* Full compatibility with the available [Subsonic clients](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp)
* Use all metadata from iTunes
* Update play counts, last played dates, ratings, etc..  on iTunes
* Use iTunes interface to manage your music
* Learning Go ;)

Currently implementing [API version](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp#versions):

* _1.0.0 &larr; In progress_
* 1.2.0
