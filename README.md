### About

__This is still a work in progress, and has no releases available__

GoSonic is an application that implements the [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp), but instead of
having its own music library like the original [Subsonic application](http://www.subsonic.org), it interacts directly
with your iTunes library.

The project's main goals are:

* Full compatibility with the available [Subsonic clients](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp)
  (only being tested with
    [DSub](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp#dsub),
    [Jamstash](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp#jamstash))
* Use all metadata from iTunes
* Use iTunes interface to manage your music
* Update play counts, last played dates, ratings, etc..  on iTunes
* Learning Go ;) [![Gopher](https://blog.golang.org/favicon.ico)](https://golang.org)

Currently implementing [API version](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp#versions):

* _1.0.0 &larr; In progress_
* 1.2.0
